# Recommender_System

This project uses four datasets to apply basic machine learning classification algorithms and see how well do they perform.
The initial idea was to collect data from my Spotify playlists. The data would consist of liked songs and disliked songs and 
then the classification methods are applied on it.

Dataset 1 (my extracted dataset), dataset 2 (available on kaggle, link is provided), and dataset 4 (link available on a paper mentioned in the report) are uploaded in this repository.
Dataset 3 was collected personally via emailing (reference is provided for the person) and therefore the dataset is not provided here. Without his consent, I would not be able to give you the access to his dataset.

Further analysis is provided in the FPR report.
